<summary><em>Technical Details (optional)</em></summary>
<p>In order to exploit the SAFE_MODE firmware of our system, we need to inject an exploited WiFi profile.</p>
<p>We can do this using an existing exploit, BannerBomb3.</p>
<p>To accomplish this, we use your system's encryption key (movable.sed) to build a DSiWare backup that exploits the system in order to inject the exploited WiFi profile into your connections list.</p>
<p>Once the WiFi profile has been injected, we will use SAFE_MODE, which is a recovery feature present on all 3DS consoles, to activate the exploited WiFi profile.</p>
<p>For a more technical explanation, see the following links for information on the BannerBomb3 and unSAFE_MODE exploits: <a href="https://github.com/zoogie/Bannerbomb3">BannerBomb3</a>, <a href="https://github.com/zoogie/unSAFE_MODE/">unSAFE_MODE</a>.</p>

### Compatibility Notes

These instructions work on USA, Europe, Japan, and Korea region consoles as indicated by the letters U, E, J, or K after the system version.

If your (Right/Left Shoulder), (D-Pad Up), or (A) buttons do not work, you will need to follow [an alternate branch of Seedminer](installing-boot9strap-(fredtool)). For assistance with this matter, join [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) and ask, in English, for help.

#### Sekcja I - Przygotowanie

In this section, you will copy the files needed to trigger the unSAFE_MODE exploit onto your device's SD card.

1. Your SD card should be inserted in your computer
1. Copy `usm.bin` to the root of your SD card
1. Copy `boot.firm` and `boot.3dsx` from the Luma3DS `.zip` to the root of your SD card
  + The root of the SD card refers to the initial directory on your SD card where you can see the Nintendo 3DS folder, but are not inside of it
1. Stwórz folder o nazwie `boot9strap` w katalogu głównym karty SD
1. Skopiuj `boot9strap.firm` i `boot9strap.firm.sha` z boot9strap `.zip` do folderu `/boot9strap/` na karcie SD
1. Copy `SafeB9SInstaller.bin` from the SafeB9SInstaller `.zip` to the root of your SD card

#### Section II - BannerBomb3

In this section, you will trigger the BannerBomb3 exploit using the DSiWare Management menu, which can be used to overwrite your Wi-Fi slots with hacked data. Your Wi-Fi connection settings will be temporarily overwritten while the exploit is active.

1. Włóż ponownie kartę SD do konsoli
1. Włącz konsolę
1. Uruchom "System Settings" na twoim urządzeniu
1. Navigate to `Data Management` -> `DSiWare`-> `SD Card` ([image](/images/screenshots/bb3/dsiware-management.png))
  + Your device should show the BB3 multihax menu
  + If this step causes your device to crash, [follow this troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting#dsiware-management-menu-crashes-without-showing-bb3-multihax-menu)
1. Use the D-Pad to navigate and press the (A) button to select "Install unSAFE_MODE"
  + Your device will automatically power off

#### Section III - unSAFE_MODE

In this section, you will enter Safe Mode (a feature available on all 3DS family devices) and navigate to a menu where unSAFE_MODE will be triggered, which will launch you into the boot9strap (custom firmware) installer.

1. With your device still powered off, hold the following buttons: (Left Shoulder) + (Right Shoulder) + (D-Pad Up) + (A), and while holding these buttons together, power on your device
  + Keep holding the buttons until the device boots into Safe Mode (a "system update" menu)
  + If you're unable to get into Safe Mode after multiple attempts, one of your buttons may be failing or broken. If this is the case, you will need to follow [an alternate branch of BannerBomb3](installing-boot9strap-(fredtool)). For assistance with this matter, join [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) and ask, in English, for help.
1. Press "OK" to accept the update
  + There is no update. This is part of the exploit
1. Press "I accept" to accept the terms and conditions
1. The update will eventually fail, with the error code `003-1099`. This is intended behaviour
1. When asked "Would you like to configure Internet settings?", select "Yes"
1. On the following menu, navigate to `Connection 1` -> `Change Settings` -> `Next Page (right arrow)` -> `Proxy Settings` -> `Detailed Setup` ([image](/images/screenshots/usm/safemode_highlighted.png))
1. If the exploit was successful, your device will have booted into SafeB9SInstaller
  + If your device instead shows a red screen, you are missing `usm.bin` from the root of your SD card

#### Section IV - Installing boot9strap

In this section, you will install custom firmware onto your device.

1. When prompted, input the key combo given on the top screen to install boot9strap
  + If the top screen is blank, power off your device and re-do Section III
1. Once it is complete, press (A) to reboot your device
1. Twoje urządzenie powinno uruchomić się ponownie i załadować menu konfiguracji Luma3DS
  + If your device shuts down when you try to power it on, ensure that you have copied `boot.firm` from the Luma3DS `.zip` to the root of your SD card
1. Naciśnij (Start) aby zapisać zmiany i uruchomić konsolę ponownie

At this point, your console will boot to Luma3DS by default.
  + Luma3DS does not look any different from the normal HOME Menu. If your console has booted into the HOME Menu, it is running custom firmware.
  + On the next page, you will install useful homebrew applications to complete your setup.

#### Section V - Restoring WiFi Configuration Profiles

In this section, you will trigger the BannerBomb3 exploit a second time so that you can restore the Wi-Fi connection slots that were overwritten in Section II.

1. Uruchom "System Settings" na twoim urządzeniu
1. Navigate to `Data Management` -> `DSiWare`-> `SD Card` ([image](/images/screenshots/bb3/dsiware-management.png))
1. Use the D-Pad to navigate and press the (A) button to select "Uninstall unSAFE_MODE"
  + Your device will automatically reboot
1. Wyłącz konsolę
1. Włóż kartę SD do komputera
1. Navigate to `Nintendo 3DS` -> `<ID0>` -> `<ID1>` -> `Nintendo DSiWare` on your SD card
1. Delete `F00D43D5.bin` from your Nintendo DSiWare folder and from your computer. This file will not be needed anymore
