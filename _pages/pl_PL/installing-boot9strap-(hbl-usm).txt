<summary><em>Technical Details (optional)</em></summary>
<p>In order to exploit the SAFE_MODE firmware of our system, we need to inject an exploited WiFi profile.</p>
<p>As we already have Homebrew access, we can use slotTool to do this.</p>
<p>Once the WiFi profile has been injected, we will use SAFE_MODE, which is a recovery feature present on all 3DS consoles, to activate the exploited WiFi profile.</p>
<p>For a more technical explanation, see <a href="https://github.com/zoogie/unSAFE_MODE/">here</a> for information about the unSAFE_MODE exploit.</p>

### Compatibility Notes

### Czego Potrzebujesz

* The latest release of [SafeB9SInstaller](https://github.com/d0k3/SafeB9SInstaller/releases/download/v0.0.7/SafeB9SInstaller-20170605-122940.zip) (direct download)

  * You may already have this from a prior section of the guide

#### Sekcja I - Przygotowanie

In this section, you will use Homebrew Launcher to launch slotTool, which will overwrite your Wi-Fi slots with hacked data. Then, you will copy the files needed to trigger the unSAFE_MODE exploit onto your device's SD card. Your Wi-Fi connection settings will be temporarily overwritten while the exploit is active.

1. Your console should be powered on and showing the Homebrew Launcher from the previous part of the guide
  + If not, power on your console and enter Homebrew Launcher through your method of choice (likely Pokémon Picross)
1. Launch slotTool from the list of homebrew
  + If you get stuck on a red screen, forcefully power off the console by holding the power button for fifteen seconds, then retry this section
1. Select the "INSTALL exploit to wifi slots 1,2,3 & shutdown" option
  + You will see some on-screen text and then your system will shut down
1. Remove your SD card from your console and connect it to your computer
1. Stwórz folder o nazwie `boot9strap` w katalogu głównym karty SD
1. Skopiuj `boot9strap.firm` i `boot9strap.firm.sha` z boot9strap `.zip` do folderu `/boot9strap/` na karcie SD
1. Copy `SafeB9SInstaller.bin` from the SafeB9SInstaller `.zip` to the root of your SD card
1. Copy `usm.bin` from the unSAFE_MODE `.zip` to the root of your SD card
1. Put your SD card back into your console

#### Section II - unSAFE_MODE

In this section, you will enter Safe Mode (a feature available on all 3DS family devices) and navigate to a menu where unSAFE_MODE will be triggered, which will launch you into the boot9strap (custom firmware) installer.

1. With your device still powered off, hold the following buttons: (Left Shoulder) + (Right Shoulder) + (D-Pad Up) + (A), and while holding these buttons together, power on your device
  + Keep holding the buttons until the device boots into Safe Mode (a "system update" menu)
  + If you're unable to get into Safe Mode after multiple attempts, one of your buttons may be failing or broken. If this is the case, join [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) and ask, in English, for help.
1. Press "OK" to accept the update
  + There is no update. This is part of the exploit
1. Press "I accept" to accept the terms and conditions
1. The update will eventually fail, with the error code `003-1099`. This is intended behaviour
1. When asked "Would you like to configure Internet settings?", select "Yes"
1. On the following menu, navigate to `Connection 1` -> `Change Settings` -> `Next Page (right arrow)` -> `Proxy Settings` -> `Detailed Setup` ([image](/images/screenshots/usm/safemode_highlighted.png))
1. If the exploit was successful, your device will have booted into SafeB9SInstaller

#### Sekcja III - Instalacja boot9strap

In this section, you will install custom firmware onto your device.

1. When prompted, input the key combo given on the top screen to install boot9strap
  + If the top screen is blank, power off your device and re-do Section III
1. Once it is complete, press (A) to reboot your device
1. Twoje urządzenie powinno uruchomić się ponownie i załadować menu konfiguracji Luma3DS
  + If your device shuts down when you try to power it on, ensure that you have copied `boot.firm` from the Luma3DS `.zip` to the root of your SD card
1. Naciśnij (Start) aby zapisać zmiany i uruchomić konsolę ponownie

At this point, your console will boot to Luma3DS by default.
  + Luma3DS does not look any different from the normal HOME Menu. If your console has booted into the HOME Menu, it is running custom firmware.
  + On the next page, you will install useful homebrew applications to complete your setup.

#### Section IV - Restoring WiFi Configuration Profiles

In this section, you will enter the Homebrew Launcher (this time using custom firmware) so that you can restore the Wi-Fi connection slots that were overwritten in Section II.
