### Okumanız Gerekli

The file `boot.firm` is what is launched by boot9strap itself after it finishes loading off of NAND. In this case, we are using Luma3DS by [LumaTeam](https://github.com/LumaTeam/) to patch the device, allowing it to run homebrew software.

On this page, we will make critical system file backups and install the following homebrew programs:

+  **FBI** *(installs CIA formatted applications)*
+  **Anemone3DS** *(installs custom themes)*
+  **Checkpoint** *(backs up and restores save files for 3DS and DS games)*
+  **Universal-Updater** *(a homebrew app store for downloading homebrew from the 3DS over Wi-Fi)*
+  **GodMode9** *(multipurpose tool which can do NAND and cartridge functions)*
+  **Homebrew Launcher Loader** *(launches the Homebrew Launcher)*

It is not recommended to skip downloading any of these applications, as many of them will be used later on this page. At the end of this page, your SD card will be cleaned up by removing unnecessary installation files.
{: .notice--warning}

If your **New 3DS** was on version 2.1.0 before following this guide, you should [restore your NAND backup](godmode9-usage#restoring-a-nand-backup) before continuing.

If your previous CFW setup was EmuNAND-based and you wish to move the contents of your EmuNAND/RedNAND to SysNAND, follow [Move EmuNAND](move-emunand) before following this page. If you don't know what an EmuNAND is, this doesn't apply to you.
