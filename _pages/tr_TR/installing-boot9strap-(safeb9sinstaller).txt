1. Launch udsploit from the list of homebrew
1. Once you see `patching kernel... done`, press (Start) to exit udsploit
  + This may take several tries
  + Eğer donarsa, konsolun kapatma tuşuna konsol kapanana kadar basın, sonra tekrar deneyin
1. Launch safehax from the list of homebrew
  + If you get a "PM INIT FAILED" error, make sure you ran udsploit with Wireless Communication turned on
  + If you *still* get a "PM INIT FAILED" error, try using the [r19 release of safehax](https://github.com/TiniVi/safehax/releases/tag/r19)
  + Eğer donarsa, konsolun kapatma tuşuna konsol kapanana kadar basın, sonra tekrar deneyin
1. If the exploit was successful, you will have booted into SafeB9SInstaller

#### Bölüm II - boot9strap kurulumu

1. When prompted, input the key combo given on the top screen to install boot9strap
1. Once it is complete, press (A) to reboot your device
1. Your device should have rebooted into the Luma3DS configuration menu
  + If your device shuts down when you try to power it on, ensure that you have copied `boot.firm` from the Luma3DS `.zip` to the root of your SD card
1. Kaydedip yeniden başlatmak için (Start) basın
  + If you get an error, just continue to the next page

At this point, your console will boot to Luma3DS by default.
  + Luma3DS does not look any different from the normal HOME Menu. If your console has booted into the HOME Menu, it is running custom firmware.
  + On the next page, you will install useful homebrew applications to complete your setup.
