### Lectură obligatorie

In order to exploit the SAFE_MODE firmware of our system, we need to inject an exploited WiFi profile.

As we already have Homebrew access, we can use slotTool to do this.

Once the WiFi profile has been injected, we will use SAFE_MODE, which is a recovery feature present on all 3DS consoles, to activate the exploited WiFi profile.

If your (Right/Left Shoulder), (D-Pad Up) or (A) buttons do not work, join [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) and ask, in English, for help.
