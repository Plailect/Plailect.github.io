### קריאה דרושה

In order to exploit the SAFE_MODE firmware of our system, we need to inject an exploited WiFi profile.

We can do this using an existing exploit, BannerBomb3.

To accomplish this, we use your system's encryption key (movable.sed) to build a DSiWare backup that exploits the system in order to inject the exploited WiFi profile into your connections list.

Once the WiFi profile has been injected, we will use SAFE_MODE, which is a recovery feature present on all 3DS consoles, to activate the exploited WiFi profile.

These instructions work on USA, Europe, Japan, and Korea region consoles as indicated by the letters U, E, J, or K after the system version.

If your (Right/Left Shoulder), (D-Pad Up), or (A) buttons do not work, you will need to follow [an alternate branch of Seedminer](bannerbomb3). For assistance with this matter, join [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) and ask, in English, for help.

### What You Need

* Your `movable.sed` file from completing [Seedminer](seedminer)
* The latest release of [SafeB9SInstaller](https://github.com/d0k3/SafeB9SInstaller/releases/download/v0.0.7/SafeB9SInstaller-20170605-122940.zip) (direct download)
* The latest release of [boot9strap](https://github.com/SciresM/boot9strap/releases/download/1.4/boot9strap-1.4.zip) (direct download)

#### חלק I - הכנות

1. If your device is powered on, power off your device
1. Open [unSAFE_MODE Exploit Injector](https://3ds.nhnarwhal.com/3dstools/unsafemode.php) on your computer
1. Upload your movable.sed using the "Choose File" option
1. Click "Build and Download"
  + This will download an exploit DSiWare called `F00D43D5.bin` and a SAFE_MODE exploit data file called `usm.bin` inside of a zip archive (`unSAFE_MODE.zip`)
1. תכניסו את ה-SD שלכם למחשב
1. Copy `boot.firm` and `boot.3dsx` from the Luma3DS `.zip` to the root of your SD card
  + The root of the SD card refers to the initial directory on your SD card where you can see the Nintendo 3DS folder, but are not inside of it
1. תצרו ב-SD שלכם תיקייה חדשה בשם `boot9strap`
1. תעתיקו את`boot9strap.firm` ואת `boot9strap.firm.sha` מה `.zip` של boot9strap אל תיקיית `/boot9strap/`על כרטיס הSD שלכם
1. Copy `SafeB9SInstaller.bin` from the SafeB9SInstaller `.zip` to the root of your SD card
1. Copy `usm.bin` from `unSAFE_MODE.zip` to the root of your SD card
  + ![]({{ "/images/screenshots/usm-root-layout.png" | absolute_url }})
    {: .notice--info}

1. Navigate to `Nintendo 3DS` -> `<ID0>` -> `<ID1>` on your SD card
  + The `<ID0>` will be the same one that you used in [Seedminer](seedminer)
  + The `<ID1>` is a 32 character long folder inside of the `<ID0>`
1. Create a folder named `Nintendo DSiWare` inside of the `<ID1>`
  + If you already had the folder *and* there are any existing DSiWare backup files (`<8-character-id>.bin`) inside, copy them to your PC and remove them from your SD card
1. Copy the `F00D43D5.bin` file from `unSAFE_MODE.zip` to the `Nintendo DSiWare` folder

#### Section II - BannerBomb3

1. תכניסו מחדש את כרטיס הSD שלכם לתוך המכשיר שלכם
1. תפעילו את המכשיר
1. Launch System Settings on your device
1. Navigate to `Data Management` -> `DSiWare`
1. Click on the SD Card section
  + Your device should show a menu with some text
  + If this step causes your device to crash, [follow this troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting#dsiware-management-menu-crashes-without-showing-usm-menu)
1. Select "Inject haxx"
  + Your device will automatically power off

#### Section III - unSAFE_MODE

1. With your device still powered off, hold the following buttons: (Left Shoulder) + (Right Shoulder) + (D-Pad Up) + (A), and while holding these buttons together, power on your device
  + Keep holding the buttons until the device boots into Safe Mode
  + If you're unable to get into Safe Mode after multiple attempts, one of your buttons may be failing or broken. If this is the case, you will need to follow [an alternate branch of Seedminer](bannerbomb3). For assistance with this matter, join [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) and ask, in English, for help.
1. Press "OK" to accept the update
  + There is no update. This is part of the exploit
1. Press "I accept" to accept the terms and conditions
1. The update will eventually fail, with the error code `003-1099`. This is intended behaviour
1. When asked "Would you like to configure Internet settings?", select "Yes"
1. On the following menu, navigate to `Connection 1` -> `Change Settings` -> `Next Page (right arrow)` -> `Proxy Settings` -> `Detailed Setup`
  + This is a [visual representation](/images/safemode_highlighted.png)
1. If the exploit was successful, your device will have booted into SafeB9SInstaller

#### Section IV - Installing boot9strap

1. When prompted, input the key combo given on the top screen to install boot9strap
  + If the top screen is blank, power off your device and re-do Section III
1. Once it is complete, press (A) to reboot your device
1. הקןנסולה שלכם צריכה לאתחל לתפריט ההגדרות של Luma3DS
  + If your device shuts down when you try to power it on, ensure that you have copied `boot.firm` from the Luma3DS `.zip` to the root of your SD card
1. לחצו על (Start) על מנת לשמור ולהפעיל מחדש

At this point, your console will boot to Luma3DS by default.
  + Luma3DS does not look any different from the normal HOME Menu. If your console has booted into the HOME Menu, it is running custom firmware.
  + On the next page, you will install useful homebrew applications to complete your setup.

#### Section V - Restoring WiFi Configuration Profiles

1. Launch System Settings on your device
1. Navigate to `Data Management` -> `DSiWare`
1. Click on the SD Card section
  + Your device should show a menu with some text
1. Select "Restore slots"
  + Your device will automatically reboot
1. תכבו את המכשיר
1. תכניסו את ה-SD שלכם למחשב
1. Navigate to `Nintendo 3DS` -> `<ID0>` -> `<ID1>` -> `Nintendo DSiWare` on your SD card
1. Delete `F00D43D5.bin` from your Nintendo DSiWare folder
