<summary><em>Dettagli Tecnici (opzionale)</em></summary>

Per installare boot9strap nella tua console, ne ricaviamo la sua univoca chiave di cifratura. To accomplish this, we use the Homebrew Launcher to launch nimhax and dump the data encryption key (movable.sed) from your device.

For a more technical explanation, see [here](https://github.com/luigoalma/nimhax/) for information about the nimhax exploit.

### Cosa serve

* The latest release of [nimhax](https://github.com/luigoalma/nimhax/releases/latest) (the nimhax `.zip` file)

### Istruzioni

#### Sezione I - Preparazione

1. Spegni il tuo 3DS
1. Inserisci la scheda SD nel tuo computer
1. Copy the `nimhax` folder from the nimhax `.zip` to the `/3ds/` folder on your SD card
1. Reinserisci la scheda SD nella tua console
1. Accendi la console

#### Section II - nimhax

1. Open the Homebrew Launcher through your method of choice (likely the Internet Browser)
1. Launch nimhax from the list of homebrew
1. If the exploit was successful, a `movable.sed` file will appear on the root of your SD card

### Next step: Choose an exploit

#### Bannerbomb3 (recommended)

Once you have your device's encryption key (`movable.sed`), you can use it in conjunction with BannerBomb3, which uses your `movable.sed` file to take advantage of exploits in the System Settings application.

#### Frogtool

Once you have your device's encryption key (`movable.sed`), you can use it in conjunction with Frogtool, which uses your `movable.sed` file to inject and take advantage of JPN Flipnote Studio. \
While this method is faster, it requires downloading a file with a torrent client. Do not follow this method if you're unable to use a torrent client.
