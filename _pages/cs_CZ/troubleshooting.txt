# Seedminer

## Bruteforce Movable skips to step 4

The website has already mined your `movable.sed` using your friend code and ID0 combination. You can use the `movable.sed` that it provides you.

## Important! You have been locked out of the automated part1 dumper system...

Your friend code was blocked from using the friend code bot because your 3DS did not successfully friend the bot. Ensure your 3DS is properly connected to the Internet, then join [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) and ask to be unlocked.

## We were unable to successfully complete your bruteforce request. :`(

The website has determined that your `movable.sed` cannot be brute-forced. Ensure that you gave the correct ID0 to the website. If your ID0 is correct, then you will be unable to use Seedminer and you will have to use an alternate method that will require additional games or hardware.

# Installing boot9strap (PicHaxx)

## "An exception occurred" or Errdisp when running Picross

Your device already has custom firmware. You should [check for CFW](checking-for-cfw).

## "An error has occurred, forcing the software to close..." (white message box)

There is an issue with your `otherapp.bin` file. Download the latest release of [universal-otherapp](https://github.com/TuxSH/universal-otherapp/releases/latest) and place it on the root of your SD card. Do not add the `.bin` extension if you do not already see it.

## "An error has occurred. Hold down the POWER button to turn off the power..." (black screen with text)

Your `00000001.sav` and/or `otherapp.bin` files may be misplaced. Ensure that `00000001.sav` is in `Nintendo 3DS` -> `<ID0>` -> `<ID1>` -> `title` -> `00040000` -> `0017c100` -> `data` and that `otherapp.bin` is on the root of your SD card.

If your files are in the correct locations, re-create the save using the [PicHaxx Save Tool](https://3ds.nhnarwhal.com/3dstools/pichaxx.php), then place it in `Nintendo 3DS` -> `<ID0>` -> `<ID1>` -> `title` -> `00040000` -> `0017c100` -> `data`. Ensure that the file is named exactly `00000001.sav` and that you used your console's `movable.sed` to create it. Re-download the latest release of [universal-otherapp](https://github.com/TuxSH/universal-otherapp/releases/latest) and place it on the root of your SD card. Do not add the `.bin` extension if you do not already see it.

## Game starts normally

Your modified `00000001.sav` file may be misplaced, or you may have used the wrong `movable.sed` when creating it. Re-create the save using the [PicHaxx Save Tool](https://3ds.nhnarwhal.com/3dstools/pichaxx.php), then place it in `Nintendo 3DS` -> `<ID0>` -> `<ID1>` -> `title` -> `00040000` -> `0017c100` -> `data`.

## Failed to open SafeB9SInstaller.bin

The file `SafeB9SInstaller.bin` is missing or misplaced. Download the latest release of [SafeB9SInstaller](https://github.com/d0k3/SafeB9SInstaller/releases/tag/v0.0.7) and place it on the root of your SD card. Do not add the `.bin`extension if you do not already see it.

## Frozen on "Doing agbhax..."

There may be an issue with your `otherapp.bin` file. Download the latest release of [universal-otherapp](https://github.com/TuxSH/universal-otherapp/releases/latest) and place it on the root of your SD card. Do not add the `.bin` extension if you do not already see it.

## "PrepareArm9ForTwl returned error c8804631!"

You will need to follow an alternate method, like [BannerBomb3](bannerbomb3).

# Installing boot9strap (Soundhax)

## Red/purple/pink and white screen after running Soundhax

If your device is on system version 9.4.0, 9.5.0, or 9.6.0, you may be encountering a bug with universal-otherapp. Follow [Homebrew Launcher (Soundhax)](homebrew-launcher-(soundhax)) instead.

If your device is not on those firmwares, it likely indicates that you already have custom firmware. You should [check for CFW](checking-for-cfw).

## "An error has occurred, forcing the software to close..." (white message box)

There is an issue with your `otherapp.bin` file (it is missing, misplaced, or corrupted). Download the latest release of [universal-otherapp](https://github.com/TuxSH/universal-otherapp/releases/latest) and place it on the root of your SD card.

## "Could not play"

You have the wrong Soundhax file for your device and region, or your device is incompatible with Soundhax. In the latter case, you should update your device to the latest version and follow [Seedminer](seedminer).

## Failed to open SafeB9SInstaller.bin

The file `SafeB9SInstaller.bin` is missing or misplaced. Download the latest release of [SafeB9SInstaller](https://github.com/d0k3/SafeB9SInstaller/releases/tag/v0.0.7) and place it on the root of your SD card. Do not add the `.bin`extensoin if you do not already see it.

## Frozen on "Doing agbhax..."

There may be an issue with your `otherapp.bin` file. Re-download the latest release of [universal-otherapp](https://github.com/TuxSH/universal-otherapp/releases/latest), rename it to `arm11code.bin`, and place it on the root of your SD card.

If you have a Taiwanese or Mainland Chinese unit (with a T or C in the version string, ie. 11.14.0-##T), join [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) for assistance.

## "PrepareArm9ForTwl returned error c8804631!"

You will need to follow an alternate method. Join [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) for assistance.

# BannerBomb3

## DSiWare Management menu does not crash

`F00D43D5.bin` is missing from `Nintendo 3DS` -> `<ID0>` `<ID1>` -> `Nintendo DSiWare`. Make sure that `Nintendo DSiWare` is correctly spelled and spaced. Uppercase/lowercase does not matter.

## DSiWare Management shows a question mark

There may be an issue with your `F00D43D5.bin` file (it may be corrupted or intended for the wrong 3DS). Re-create your `F00D43D5.bin`file with the [BannerBomb3 tool](https://3ds.nhnarwhal.com/3dstools/bannerbomb3.php), ensuring that you use the `movable.sed` file for your console.

## DSiWare Management menu crashes without purple screen

Ensure that `F00D43D5.bin` is the only file in `Nintendo 3DS` -> `<ID0>` `<ID1>` -> `Nintendo DSiWare`. If it is, then re-create it with the [BannerBomb3 tool](https://3ds.nhnarwhal.com/3dstools/bannerbomb3.php). If this fails, then custom firmware may have been uninstalled on this device in a way that makes this method impossible to perform. If this is the case, join [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) for assistance.

# Installing boot9strap (Fredtool)

## Error on Fredtool Injector page

Ensure that your `movable.sed` and DSiWare backup come from the same console. A mismatch will result in an error.

## "Haxxxxxxxxx!" does not appear

There is an issue with your `42383821.bin` file (it is incorrect, missing, misplaced, or corrupted). Re-create your files with the [Fredtool](https://3ds.nhnarwhal.com/3dstools/fredtool.php) website and ensure that you place the `42383821.bin` file from `output.zip` -> `hax` in `Nintendo 3DS` -> `<ID0>` `<ID1>` -> `Nintendo DSiWare`.

## DS Connection Settings launches normally

`Haxxxxxxxxx!` was not copied from your SD card to your system memory.

## Black screen when launching DS Connection Settings

Your DS Connection Settings application is broken, and you will need Homebrew Launcher access to fix this issue. Join [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) for assistance.

## SD card is grayed out

Flipnote may take a long time to index your card if you have a large SD card. Let it sit for a few minutes.

## Lenny face does not appear

You did not copy the `private` folder from the Frogminer_save `.zip` to the root of your SD card.

## Flipnote is frozen

You may have accidentally touched the touch screen while in the modified Flipnote. Re-enter DS Connection Settings and try again, ensuring that you don't accidentally use the touchscreen.

## Green screen after pasting 

The file `boot.nds` is missing or misplaced. Download the latest release of [b9stool](https://github.com/zoogie/b9sTool/releases/latest) and place `boot.nds` on the root of your SD card, replacing the existing one.

## White screen after pasting

There is an issue with your `boot.nds` file. Re-download the latest release of [b9stool](https://github.com/zoogie/b9sTool/releases/latest) and place `boot.nds` on the root of your SD card, replacing the existing one.

## Unable to open Luma3DS configuration menu after running b9stool

It is possible that boot9strap was not successfully installed. Follow section B of [this page](https://github.com/zoogie/b9sTool/blob/master/TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

# Finalizing Setup

## Unable to update device

The steps below can be attempted in any order, but are listed from easiest to hardest to perform.

1. Set your DNS settings to "Auto"
1. Move closer to your WiFi router
1. Update from Safe Mode by turning off the console, holding (Left Shoulder) + (Right Shoulder) + (D-Pad Up) + (A) on boot, and following the on-screen prompts
1. Delete your WiFi connection, then reconnect to your WiFi again
1. Reboot your WiFi router
1. Connect to a different WiFi connection, like a mobile hotspot
1. Nintendo servers may be down; Try again later
1. If you still get an error, [follow CTRTransfer](ctrtransfer), then try again
1. For further support (in English), join [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp)

## Unable to enter Rosalina due to broken button(s)

Download this [alternate config.bin](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/196635695958196224/733384123003175074/config.bin) and place it in `/luma/`. This will change the Rosalina key combination to (Y) + (B).

## "An exception occurred" after trying to launch Homebrew Launcher via Download Play

There is an issue with your `boot.3dsx` file (it is missing, misplaced, or corrupted). Download the latest release of [the Homebrew Launcher](https://github.com/fincs/new-hbmenu/releases/latest) and place `boot.3dsx` on the root of your SD card, replacing any existing file. Make sure you are extracting the ZIP file with any tool other than WinRAR, as it is known to cause issues with 3DS-related files.

## "Scripts directory not found" in GodMode9

You did not copy the `gm9` folder from the GodMode9 `.zip` to the root of your SD card. Download the latest release of [GodMode9](https://github.com/d0k3/GodMode9/releases/latest) and place the `gm9` folder on the root of your SD card, merging it with the existing one.

## `essentials.exefs` missing from `/gm9/out/`

Your device had custom firmware in the past, so you were not automatically prompted to make a backup. Make a backup manually:

1. Reinsert your SD card into your device
1. Press and hold (Start), and while holding (Start), power on your device. This will launch GodMode9
1. Navigate to 	`[S:] SYSNAND VIRTUAL`
1. Select `essentials.exefs`, then `Copy to 0:/gm9/out/`
1. You should now have `essentials.exefs` in `/gm9/out/`

# Boot-related issues on modded devices

The steps detailed here generally assume that your device has a modern custom firmware setup (boot9strap + Luma3DS 8.0 or greater). If your console is running an older homebrew setup (for example, something based on arm9loaderhax or menuhax), you should update your setup before trying these instructions.

## My device gets stuck on a black light, and the blue light turns off

There is an issue with your `boot.firm` file (it is missing, misplaced, or corrupted). Download the [latest release of Luma3DS](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS/releases/latest) and place `boot.firm` on the root of your SD card, replacing any existing file. Make sure you are extracting the ZIP file with any tool other than WinRAR, as it is known to cause issues with 3DS-related files.

If you hear a "popping sound", potentially accompanied with the backlight turning on for a split second, there is a hardware issue with your device (such as a disconnected backlight cable). You may be able to get your device to boot by holding it at certain angles.

## My device gets stuck on a black screen, with a static blue light

The steps below can be attempted in any order, but are listed from least to most time-consuming.

1. Power off your device, eject the game cartridge if inserted, power on your device, then wait up to ten minutes. If your device boots within ten minutes, the issue has been fixed and is unlikely to reoccur
1. Rename the `Nintendo 3DS` folder on your SD card to `Nintendo 3DS_BACKUP`, then attempt to boot. If your device successfully boots, there is some issue within your `Nintendo 3DS` folder. Try clearing home menu extdata:
	+ Navigate to `/Nintendo 3DS/<ID0>/<ID1>/extdata/00000000/`
	+ Delete the extdata file corresponding to your region: 
		+ **EUR Region**: `00000098`
		+ **JPN Region**: `00000082`
		+ **USA Region**: `0000008f`
		+ **CHN Region**: `000000A1`
		+ **KOR Region**: `000000A9`
		+ **TWN Region**: `000000B1`
1. Ensure that your device does not have ARM11 exception handlers disabled:
	+ Power off your device
	+ Hold (Select)
	+ Power on your device, while still holding (Select)
	+ If the "Disable ARM11 exception handlers" box is checked, uncheck it
	+ If your device now boots to the "An exception occured" screen, follow [My device boots to an error screen](troubleshooting#my-device-boots-to-an-error-screen)
1. Try booting into recovery mode and updating your system:
	+ Power off your device
	+ Hold (Left Shoulder) + (Right Shoulder) + (D-Pad Up) + (A)
	+ Power on your device
	+ If you were successful, the device will boot to an "update your system" screen
1. Follow the [CTRTransfer](ctrtransfer) guide
1. For further support, ask for help at [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp)

## My device boots to an error screen

### "An error has occurred: Failed to apply 1 FIRM patch(es)" or "An exception has occurred -- Current process: pm"

Your Luma3DS version is outdated. Download the latest release of [Luma3DS](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS/releases/latest) and place `boot.firm` on the root of your SD card, replacing any existing file. Make sure you are extracting the ZIP file with any tool other than WinRAR, as it is known to cause issues with 3DS-related files.

	+ If the "Disable ARM11 exception handlers" box is checked, uncheck it

### Some other error

Please take a photo of the error and join [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) for assistance.

## Blue "Bootrom Error" screen

Your device is likely hard-bricked. You will need to buy an ntrboot flashcart to reinstall boot9strap in order to attempt to fix your device. This may also indicate a hardware issue which cannot be fixed. In any case, join [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) for assistance.
  + It is also possible that someone has set a boot-time splash screen that just looks like a brick. Try leaving your device powered on, waiting on the blue screen, for five minutes.
