**3DS firmware 11.17.0 was recently released**. Here's what you should know:

- If your device is running *Luma 11.0 or higher*, it is *100% safe* to update. You can check your Luma version by holding (Select) while booting your device.
- If your device is on an older Luma version, you should [update Luma](checking-for-cfw) before you update your device to 11.17.0.
- If your device does not yet have custom firmware, **do NOT update to the latest version**, as you will not be able to hack your console.
