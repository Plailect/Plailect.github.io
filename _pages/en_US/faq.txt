**3DS firmware 11.15.0 was recently released**. Here's what you should know:

- If your device is *currently running custom firmware on 11.14.0*, it is *100% safe* to update. NTR CFW and the Luma 3GX loader have not been affected by this update.
- If your device is *currently running custom firmware on 11.13.0 or earlier*, you should make sure that you are on *Luma3DS v10.2.1* before updating. You can check what version of Luma you have by turning off your device and holding SELECT on boot. If you are not on Luma 10.2.1, then updating will result in your device being unable to boot until you update your Luma to v10.2.1.
- If your device is *currently stock on 11.14.0*, you will have to *update your 3DS* to the latest firmware (11.15.0) in order to install custom firmware. The previous method, Browserhax, will no longer work because Nintendo enforces a browser version check that cannot be bypassed on 11.14.0.

# Pre-Installation FAQ

<a name="faq_latestfw" />**Q:** *I am on the latest system version. Is my device hackable?*    
**A:** Yes! The latest firmware (11.15.0) has a free method for getting CFW named [Seedminer](seedminer).

<a name="faq_risky" />**Q:** *How risky is hacking my console?*    
**A:** Bricks are now effectively impossible unless you are purposely trying to brick your device. 

<a name="faq_homebrew" />**Q:** *Can I run awesome homebrew and emulators with this?*    
**A:** Yes! This guide will install a few useful homebrew applications, including [Universal-Updater](https://github.com/Universal-Team/Universal-Updater/releases/latest), which acts as a homebrew app store.

<a name="faq_regionfree" />**Q:** *Can I use this to play games from other regions?*    
**A:** Yes; Luma3DS will automatically ignore the region check for cartridges and installed titles. Some games may need to make use of Luma's [locale emulation feature](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS/wiki/Optional-features) in order to work properly on out-of-region devices.

<a name="faq_loss" />**Q:** *Will I lose any features if I install CFW?*    
**A:** No. Devices with custom firmware can still use the eShop and run physical cartridges as any other 3DS can.

<a name="faq_NNID" />**Q:** *Can I keep my NNID?*    
**A:** Your NNID will not be affected by this guide.

<a name="faq_ban" />**Q:** *Will my 3DS be banned for having CFW?*    
**A:** There was a ban wave in May 2017 that banned CFW users from online play (eShop access, NNIDs, and Nintendo Accounts were unaffected), seemingly at random. A ban wave at such a scale has not been seen since. That being said, we don't know what Nintendo may have in store in the future. At this time, we don't think that bans are something that you need to worry about.

<a name="faq_nopc" />**Q:** *Can I do this without a computer (e.g. an Android phone)?*    
**A:** All you need is the ability to put files on a compatible SD card!

<a name="faq_sdsize" />**Q:** *What size SD card can I use?*    
**A:** You will need at least 1.5GB of free SD card space to follow this guide in its entirety. While the 3DS is officially compatible with SD cards up to 32GB, larger SD cards can be used if they are manually re-formatted as FAT32. It is not recommended to use SD cards greater than 128GB due to known issues with GBA graphics and themes.

<a name="faq_payment" />**Q:** *I heard about this thing I have to pay for (Gateway, Sky3DS, ntrboot, R4, etc). Is that something I need?*    
**A:** No. Custom firmware can be installed for free on the latest firmware without any hardware devices. In fact, 3DS-mode flashcarts like Gateway and Sky3DS are not recommended because they are obsolete.

# Post-Installation FAQ

<a name="faq_updates" />**Q:** *Is it safe to update my 3DS to the latest version with CFW?*    
**A:** If you are using Luma3DS, your custom firmware loader (boot9strap) will *never* be removed when performing a system update. There have been updates in the past that have resulted in Luma temporarily displaying an error message until a line or two is updated, so it is a good idea to wait a couple of hours to ensure that the latest update will not temporarily render the device unusable.

<a name="faq_movesd" />**Q:** *How do I upgrade my SD card?*    
**A:** Copy and paste your SD card contents to a new SD card formatted as FAT32.

<a name="faq_systransfer" />**Q:** *How do I system transfer with CFW?*    
**A:** System transfers can be performed through the official System Transfer function to other consoles with CFW. Tickets for illegitimate titles (homebrew) will not transfer, but can be made to reappear with [faketik](https://github.com/ihaveamac/faketik/releases/latest). Make sure that you do not perform a wireless transfer, as this will delete illegitimate titles.  

<a name="faq_oorupdates" />**Q:** *How do I update games from outside of my 3DS region?*    
**A:** You will need to [dump the updates](dumping-titles-and-game-cartridges) from a 3DS that has the updates installed. The Nintendo eShop only contains updates for the console's region (a Japanese 3DS will only have updates for Japanese games).

<a name="faq_language" />**Q:** *How do I change the system language of a Japanese 3DS?*    
**A:** The only way to change the system language of a Japanese 3DS to a language other than Japanese is to perform a [region change](region-changing). Note that this is very likely to break the Nintendo eShop on your device, which means you will be unable to update your games whether they are in-region or out-of-region.

<a name="faq_problem" />**Q:** *Help! Something bad happened and now I cannot boot...*    
**A:** Please look at the [troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting).

# menuhax / A9LH / Gateway FAQ

<a name="faq_existingmod" />**Q:** *I modded my device x years ago. What should I do?*    
**A:** It is recommended that you upgrade your setup to a modern, boot9strap-based one. Follow the [Checking for CFW](checking-for-cfw) guide to see how to upgrade your setup.

<a name="faq_whyupgrade" />**Q:** *My setup works for me. Why should I upgrade it?*    
**A:** The vast majority of modern homebrew (such as Checkpoint and BootNTR Selector) have only been tested on modern, boot9strap-based setups and may not work entirely (or at all) on older setups based on menuhax, A9LH, or Gateway. In addition, depending on your setup, you may be unable to safely update to the latest firmware. Modern, boot9strap-based setups allow for the greatest level of system access, including the ability to dump your console's bootrom.

<a name="faq_gatewaysaves" />**Q:** *How do I move saves from an existing Gateway setup to a more modern setup?*    
**A:** See [this thread](https://gbatemp.net/threads/425743/).
