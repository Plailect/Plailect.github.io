<summary><em>Technical Details (optional)</em></summary>

Now that the hacked payload has been sent, we inject the exploited WiFi profile into your connections list.

Once the WiFi profile has been injected, we will use SAFE_MODE, which is a recovery feature present on all 3DS consoles, to activate the exploited WiFi profile.

For a more technical explanation, see the following links for information on the kartdlphax and unSAFE_MODE exploits: [kartdlphax](https://github.com/PabloMK7/kartdlphax), [unSAFE_MODE](https://github.com/zoogie/unSAFE_MODE/).

### What You Need

* The latest release of [SafeB9SInstaller](https://github.com/d0k3/SafeB9SInstaller/releases/download/v0.0.7/SafeB9SInstaller-20170605-122940.zip)
* The latest release of [boot9strap](https://github.com/SciresM/boot9strap/releases/download/1.4/boot9strap-1.4.zip)

### Instructions

#### Section I - Injecting unSAFE_MODE

1. Press (X) to inject unSAFE_MODE
1. If the injection was successful, the screen will turn green and the **target 3DS** will automatically power off
  + If the screen turns red, power off the target 3DS and start again from the beginning of [Section III - kartdlphax on the previous page](3dsropxploitinjector-(kartdlphax)#section-iv---kartdlphax). If this doesn't work, ask for help at [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp))

You will **not** need to use your **source 3DS** to complete any further steps on this guide. Any further steps should only be completed on the **target 3DS**.

#### Section II - Prep Work

1. Insert your SD card into your computer
1. Create a folder named `3ds` on the root of your SD card if it does not already exist

1. Copy the `slotTool` folder from the unSAFE_MODE `.zip` to the `3ds` folder on your SD card
1. Copy `usm.bin` from the unSAFE_MODE `.zip` to the root of your SD card
1. Create a folder named `boot9strap` on the root of your SD card
1. Copy `boot9strap.firm` and `boot9strap.firm.sha` from the boot9strap `.zip` to the `/boot9strap/` folder on your SD card
1. Copy `SafeB9SInstaller.bin` from the SafeB9SInstaller `.zip` to the root of your SD card
1. Copy `boot.firm` and `boot.3dsx` from the Luma3DS `.zip` to the root of your SD card
1. Reinsert the SD card into your console
