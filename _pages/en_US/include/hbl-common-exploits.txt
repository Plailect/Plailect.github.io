### Next step: Choose an exploit

If the camera application appeared in the previous section, Safe Mode is likely to be working on your console.
  - If your console instead showed an error message, your camera application did appear, but crashed.

If the camera appeared, continue to [Installing boot9strap (HBL-USM)](installing-boot9strap-(hbl-usm))
{: .notice--primary}

If the camera did NOT appear, continue to [Dumping Movable (nimhax)](dumping-movable-(nimhax))
{: .notice--info}
