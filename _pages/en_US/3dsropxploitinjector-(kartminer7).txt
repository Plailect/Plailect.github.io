<summary><em>Technical Details (optional)</em></summary>

To install boot9strap on your console, we derive your console's unique encryption key. To accomplish this, we use a tool called Seedminer to calculate the data encryption key (movable.sed) for your console.

Once we have `movable.sed`, we can edit the SD card data of the game Mario Kart 7 to allow us to install further exploits.

See [here](https://github.com/zoogie/kartminer7) for information about kartminer7 and [here](https://github.com/PabloMK7/3dsropxploitinjector) for information about 3DS ROP xPloit Injector.
