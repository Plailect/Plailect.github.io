<summary><em>Technical Details (optional)</em></summary>

To install boot9strap on your device, we derive your device's unique encryption key. To accomplish this, we use a tool called nimhax (along with another exploit to run nimhax) to dump the data encryption key (movable.sed) from your device.

For a more technical explanation, see [here](https://github.com/luigoalma/nimhax/) for information about the nimhax exploit.

### What You Need

* The latest release of [nimhax](https://github.com/luigoalma/nimhax/releases/latest) (the nimhax `.zip` file)

### Instructions

#### Section I - Prep Work

1. Power off your device
1. Insert your SD card into your computer
1. Create a folder named `3ds` on the root of your SD card, if it does not already exist
1. Copy the `nimhax` folder from your nimhax `.zip` to the `/3ds/` folder on your SD card
1. Reinsert your SD card into your device
1. Power on your device

#### Section II - nimhax

1. Open the Homebrew Launcher through your method of choice (likely the Internet Browser)
1. Launch nimhax from the list of homebrew
1. If the exploit was successful, a `movable.sed` file will be available on the root of your SD card.

### Next step: BannerBomb3

Once you have your device's encryption key (`movable.sed`), you will use it in conjunction with BannerBomb3, which uses your `movable.sed` file to take advantage of exploits in the System Settings application.
