<summary><em>Technical Details (optional)</em></summary>

This method of using Seedminer for further exploitation uses your `movable.sed` file to decrypt any DSiWare title for the purposes of injecting an exploitable DSiWare title into the DS Internet Settings application.

This is a currently working implementation of the "FIRM partitions known-plaintext" exploit detailed [here](https://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/3DS_System_Flaws).

### What You Need

* Your `movable.sed` file from completing [Seedminer](seedminer)
* The latest release of [Frogminer_save](https://github.com/zoogie/Frogminer/releases/latest) (`Frogminer_save.zip`)
* The latest release of [b9sTool](https://github.com/zoogie/b9sTool/releases/latest) (`boot.nds`)
* The latest release of [Luma3DS](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS/releases/latest) (the Luma3DS `.zip` file)

#### Section I - CFW Check

As an additional safety measure, we will perform an additional check for custom firmware. This is because using this method when custom firmware is already installed has a risk of bricking the console (rendering it unusable without recovery methods like [ntrboot](ntrboot)).

1. Power off your device
1. Hold the (Select) button
1. Power on your device while still holding the (Select) button
1. If the check was successful, you will boot to the HOME Menu and you may proceed with this guide
1. Power off your device

If you see a configuration menu or the console immediately powers off, you already have CFW, and continuing with these instructions may BRICK your device! Follow [Checking for CFW](checking-for-cfw) to upgrade your existing CFW.
