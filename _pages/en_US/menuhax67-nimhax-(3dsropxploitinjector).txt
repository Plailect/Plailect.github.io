<summary><em>Technical Details (optional)</em></summary>

To install boot9strap on your console, we derive your console's unique encryption key. To accomplish this, we use the Homebrew Launcher to launch nimhax and dump the data encryption key (movable.sed) from your console.

For a more technical explanation, see [here](https://github.com/luigoalma/nimhax/) for information about the nimhax exploit and [here](https://github.com/zoogie/menuhax67) for information about menuhax67.

#### Section III - nimhax

1. Open the Homebrew Launcher by tapping the HOME Menu Settings icon on the top-left corner of the screen
1. Launch nimhax from the list of homebrew
1. If the exploit was successful, a `movable.sed` file will appear on the root of your SD card

### Next step: Frogtool

Once you have your console's encryption key (`movable.sed`), you can use it in conjunction with Frogtool, which uses your `movable.sed` file to inject and take advantage of JPN Flipnote Studio. \
