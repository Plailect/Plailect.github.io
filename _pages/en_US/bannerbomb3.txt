<summary><em>Technical Details (optional)</em></summary>
<p>To launch custom code, we exploit a flaw in the DSiWare Data Management window of the Settings application.</p>
<p>To accomplish this, we use your system's encryption key (movable.sed) to build a DSiWare backup that exploits the system.</p>
<p>For a more technical explanation, see <a href="https://github.com/zoogie/Bannerbomb3">here</a>.</p>

### Compatibility Notes

These instructions work on USA, Europe, Japan, and Korea region consoles as indicated by the letters U, E, J, or K after the system version.

If you have a Taiwanese console (indicated by a T after the system version), follow [this page](bannerbomb3-fredtool-(twn)) instead.

### What You Need

* Your `movable.sed` file from completing [Seedminer](seedminer)

#### Section I - Prep Work

In this section, you will copy the files needed to trigger the BannerBomb3 exploit onto your device's SD card.

1. Open [Bannerbomb3 Injector website](http://3dstools.nhnarwhal.com/#/bb3gen) on your computer
1. Upload your movable.sed using the “Choose File” option
1. Click “Build and Download”
  + This will download an exploit DSiWare called F00D43D5.bin and other exploit data files inside of a zip archive (`DSIWARE_EXPLOIT.zip`)
1. If your console is powered on, power off your console
1. Insert your SD card into your computer
1. Navigate to `Nintendo 3DS` -> `<ID0>` -> `<ID1>` on your SD card
  + `<ID0>` is the 32-letter folder name that you copied in [Seedminer](seedminer)
  + `<ID1>` is a 32-letter folder inside of the `<ID0>`
  ![]({{ "/images/screenshots/bb3/dsiware-location-1.png" | absolute_url }}){: .notice--info}
1. Create a folder named `Nintendo DSiWare` inside of the `<ID1>`
  + If you already had the folder *and* there are any existing DSiWare backup files (`<8-character-id>.bin`) inside, copy them to your PC and remove them from your SD card
1. Copy the `F00D43D5.bin` file from `DSIWARE_EXPLOIT.zip` to the `Nintendo DSiWare` folder
1. Copy `bb3.bin` from `DSIWARE_EXPLOIT.zip` to the root of your SD card

#### Section II - Hardware Button Check

In this section, you will test the SAFE_MODE function of your console. This will determine which method you will follow in the next section.

1. With your device still powered off, hold the following buttons: (Left Shoulder) + (Right Shoulder) + (D-Pad Up) + (A), and while holding these buttons together, power on your device
  + Keep holding the buttons until the device boots into Safe Mode (a "system update" menu)

___

### Next steps: Choose an exploit

The next steps are dependent on whether Section II booted into the SAFE_MODE successfully.

#### unSAFE_MODE (Recommended)

This method of using Seedminer for further exploitation uses your `movable.sed` file to take advantage of exploits in the SAFE_MODE firmware present in all 3DS units.

If your device booted into Safe Mode, continue to [Installing boot9strap (USM)](installing-boot9strap-(usm))
{: .notice--primary}

#### Fredtool

If you're unable to get into Safe Mode after multiple attempts, one of your buttons may be failing or broken. If this is the case, you will need to use this exploit.

This method of using Seedminer for further exploitation uses your <code>movable.sed</code> file to decrypt any DSiWare title for the purposes of injecting an exploitable DSiWare title into the DS Internet Settings application.
