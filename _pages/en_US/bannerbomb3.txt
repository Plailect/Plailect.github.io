<summary><em>Technical Details (optional)</em></summary>
<p>To launch custom code, we exploit a flaw in the DSiWare Data Management window of the Settings application.</p>
<p>To accomplish this, we use your system's encryption key (movable.sed) to build a DSiWare backup that exploits the system.</p>
<p>For a more technical explanation, see <a href="https://github.com/zoogie/Bannerbomb3">here</a>.</p>

### Compatibility Notes

These instructions work on USA, Europe, Japan, and Korea region consoles as indicated by the letters U, E, J, or K after the system version.

If you have a Taiwanese console (indicated by a T after the system version), follow [this page](bannerbomb3-fredtool-(twn)) instead.

### What You Need

* Your `movable.sed` file from completing [Seedminer](seedminer)
* The latest release of [BannerBomb3](https://github.com/zoogie/Bannerbomb3/releases/latest) (the Release `.zip` file)

#### Section I - Prep Work

In this section, you will copy the files needed to trigger the BannerBomb3 exploit onto your device's SD card.

1. Open [DSIHaxInjector](https://jenkins.nelthorya.net/job/DSIHaxInjector/build?delay=0sec) on your computer
1. Under the "Username" field, enter any alphanumeric name (no spaces or special characters)
1. Under the "MovableSed" field, upload your `movable.sed` file using the second "Browse..." option
1. Click "Build"
  + Wait a few seconds for the build process to complete
1. In the Build History section on the left, type the Username into the "Filter Builds" field
1. Click on the first search result
  + This result should have the latest timestamp
1. Click the "output_(name).zip" link
1. Insert your SD card into your computer
1. Navigate to `Nintendo 3DS` -> `<ID0>` -> `<ID1>` -> `Nintendo DSiWare` on your SD card
  + `<ID0>` is the 32-letter folder name that you copied in [Seedminer](seedminer)
  + `<ID1>` is a 32-letter folder inside of the `<ID0>`
  + This will download an exploit DSiWare called `F00D43D5.bin` inside of a zip file (`BannerBomb3.zip`)
1. If your console is powered on, power off your console
1. Insert your SD card into your computer
1. Navigate to `Nintendo 3DS` -> `<ID0>` -> `<ID1>` on your SD card
  + `<ID0>` is the 32-letter folder name that you copied in [Seedminer](seedminer)
  + `<ID1>` is a 32-letter folder inside of the `<ID0>`
  ![]({{ "/images/screenshots/bb3/dsiware-location-1.png" | absolute_url }}){: .notice--info}
1. Create a folder named `Nintendo DSiWare` inside of the `<ID1>`
  + If you already had the folder *and* there are any existing DSiWare backup files (`<8-character-id>.bin`) inside, copy them to your PC and remove them from your SD card
1. Copy the `F00D43D5.bin` file from the `Usa_Europe_Japan_Korea` directory you find in the `BannerBomb3.zip` to the `Nintendo DSiWare` folder
1. Copy `bb3.bin` from the Release `.zip` to the root of your SD card
1. Reinsert the SD card into your device


#### Section II - Button Check

1. With your device still powered off, hold the following buttons: (Left Shoulder) + (Right Shoulder) + (D-Pad Up) + (A), and while holding these buttons together, power on your device
  + Keep holding the buttons until the device boots into Safe Mode (a "system update" menu)

### Next steps

If your device booted into Safe Mode, continue to [Installing boot9strap](installing-boot9strap-(usm))

If you're unable to get into Safe Mode after multiple attempts, one of your buttons may be failing or broken. If this is the case, you will need to continue to [Installing boot9strap (Fredtool)](installing-boot9strap-(fredtool))
