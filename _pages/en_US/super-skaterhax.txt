Using this method, we will install boot9strap and Luma3DS on your New3DS/New2DS using the Super-Skaterhax method, a reimplementation of Browserhax.

#### Section I - Preparing the exploit

1. Download the files from [here](https://github.com/zoogie/super-skaterhax/releases).
1. Power off your New 3DS/2DS, and put the SD card into your computer.
1. Drag and drop the files from the zip to the root of your SD card.

#### Section II - Launching the exploit

1. Insert the SD card back into your 3DS/2DS and power it on. Open the web browser.
1. Enter one of the following URLs: https://zoogie.github.io/web/super for USA, Europe, and Japan models and https://zoogie.github.io/web/korea for Korean models.
1. Press the star on the bottom left. Ignore the "GO GO!" link on the top screen. Press "Bookmark this page", and press the star again.
1. Tap the icon on the bottom right with the 3 horizontal dashes. Press Settings, then press Delete Cookies.
1. Press the HOME button to exit the browser. Then immediately relaunch the browser by pressing A. The exit/relaunch thing saves your data if you're wondering.

With the Homebrew Launcher enabled, you can install boot9strap via unSAFE_MODE.
