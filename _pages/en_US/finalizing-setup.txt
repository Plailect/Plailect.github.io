### Required Reading

The file `boot.firm` is what is launched by boot9strap itself after it finishes loading off of NAND. In this case, we are using Luma3DS by [LumaTeam](https://github.com/LumaTeam/) to patch the device, allowing it to run homebrew software.

On this page, we will make critical system file backups and install some homebrew programs. Most of these steps will be automated using a script that you will run on your console.

### Compatibility Notes

If your **New 3DS** was on version 2.1.0 before following this guide, you should [restore your NAND backup](godmode9-usage#restoring-a-nand-backup) before continuing. This likely doesn't apply to you unless you were following this guide in 2017.
{: .notice--warning}

If your previous CFW setup was EmuNAND-based and you wish to move the contents of your EmuNAND/RedNAND to SysNAND, follow [Move EmuNAND](move-emunand) before following this page. If you don't know what an EmuNAND is, this doesn't apply to you.

### What You Need

* [finalizing.zip]({{ base_path }}/assets/finalizing.zip) (direct download)

### Instructions

#### Section I - Prep Work

In this section, you will copy the files necessary to follow the rest of the instructions on this page.

1. Power off your device
1. Insert your SD card into your computer
1. Copy the contents of `finalizing.zip` to the root of your SD card, merging/replacing any existing folders if prompted

The screenshot below indicate the minimum SD card layout that is required to follow this page. You may have extra files or folders on your SD card, depending on your previous setup or the method that you followed.

#### Section II - Updating the System

In this section, you will update your system to the latest version, which is safe to do with custom firmware.

{% include_relative include/sysupdate.txt cfw="true" %}

#### Section III - Setup Script

In this section, you will use a script to automate Luma3DS configuration, homebrew installation, SD card cleanup, and system file backup.

1. Power off your device
1. Press and hold (Start), and while holding (Start), power on your device. This will launch GodMode9
1. If you are prompted to create an essential files backup, press (A) to do so, then press (A) to continue once it has completed
1. If you are prompted to fix the RTC date&time, press (A) to do so, then set the date and time, then press (A) to continue
1. Press (Home) to bring up the action menu
1. Select "Scripts..."
1. Select "finalize"
1. Follow the prompts in the script, answering each question that you are asked
  + If you encounter an error, follow the instructions in the error message or consult the [troubleshooting](troubleshooting#finalizing-setup) page
1. Once the script says "Setup complete!", press (A) to power off the device
1. Insert your SD card into your computer
1. Copy `<date>_<serialnumber>_sysnand_##.bin`, `<date>_<serialnumber>_sysnand_##.bin.sha`, and `essential.exefs` from the `/gm9/out/` folder on your SD card to a safe location on your computer
  + Copy these backups to multiple locations (such as online file storage, an external hard drive, etc.)
  + These backups will save you from a brick and/or help you recover files from the NAND image if anything goes wrong in the future
1. Delete `<date>_<serialnumber>_sysnand_##.bin` and `<date>_<serialnumber>_sysnand_##.bin.sha` from the `/gm9/out/` folder on your SD card after copying it
  + `essential.exefs` is negligible in size and may be kept on your SD card for ease of access
1. If you have it, copy the `/luma/backups/` folder on your SD card to a safe location on your computer

Here are some key combos that you should know:

- Holding (Select) on boot will launch the Luma3DS configuration menu.
- Holding (Start) on boot will launch GodMode9, or if you have multiple payloads in `/luma/payloads/`, the Luma3DS chainloader.
- By default, pressing (Left Shoulder) + (Down D-Pad) + (Select) while in 3DS mode will open the Rosalina menu, where you can check system information, take screenshots, enable cheats, and more. This can be changed from the Rosalina menu.
