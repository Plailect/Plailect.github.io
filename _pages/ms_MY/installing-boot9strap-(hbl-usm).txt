<summary><em>Technical Details (optional)</em></summary>
<p>In order to exploit the SAFE_MODE firmware of our system, we need to inject an exploited WiFi profile.</p>
<p>As we already have Homebrew access, we can use slotTool to do this.</p>
<p>Once the WiFi profile has been injected, we will use SAFE_MODE, which is a recovery feature present on all 3DS consoles, to activate the exploited WiFi profile.</p>
<p>For a more technical explanation, see <a href="https://github.com/zoogie/unSAFE_MODE/">here</a> for information about the unSAFE_MODE exploit.</p>

### What You Need

* The latest release of [SafeB9SInstaller](https://github.com/d0k3/SafeB9SInstaller/releases/download/v0.0.7/SafeB9SInstaller-20170605-122940.zip) (direct download)
* The latest release of [boot9strap](https://github.com/SciresM/boot9strap/releases/download/1.4/boot9strap-1.4.zip) (direct download)
* The latest release of [unSAFE_MODE](https://github.com/zoogie/unSAFE_MODE/releases/latest)
  * You may already have this from a prior section of the guide

#### Section I - Prep Work

In this section, you will use Homebrew Launcher to launch slotTool, which will overwrite your Wi-Fi slots with hacked data. Then, you will copy the files needed to trigger the unSAFE_MODE exploit onto your device's SD card. Your Wi-Fi connection settings will be temporarily overwritten while the exploit is active.

1. Your console should be powered on and showing the Homebrew Launcher from the previous part of the guide
  + If not, power on your console and enter Homebrew Launcher through your method of choice (likely PokÃ©mon Picross)
1. Launch slotTool from the list of homebrew
  + If you get stuck on a red screen, forcefully power off the console by holding the power button for fifteen seconds, then retry this section
1. Select the "INSTALL exploit to wifi slots 1,2,3 & shutdown" option
  + You will see some on-screen text and then your system will shut down
1. Remove your SD card from your console and connect it to your computer
1. Create a folder named `boot9strap` on the root of your SD card
1. Copy `boot9strap.firm` and `boot9strap.firm.sha` from the boot9strap `.zip` to the `/boot9strap/` folder on your SD card
1. Copy `SafeB9SInstaller.bin` from the SafeB9SInstaller `.zip` to the root of your SD card
1. Copy `usm.bin` from the unSAFE_MODE `.zip` to the root of your SD card
1. Put your SD card back into your console

#### Section II - unSAFE_MODE

In this section, you will enter Safe Mode (a feature available on all 3DS family devices) and navigate to a menu where unSAFE_MODE will be triggered, which will launch you into the boot9strap (custom firmware) installer.

1. With your device still powered off, hold the following buttons: (Left Shoulder) + (Right Shoulder) + (D-Pad Up) + (A), and while holding these buttons together, power on your device
  + Keep holding the buttons until the device boots into Safe Mode (a "system update" menu)
  + If you're unable to get into Safe Mode after multiple attempts, one of your buttons may be failing or broken. If this is the case, join [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) and ask, in English, for help.
1. Press "OK" to accept the update
  + There is no update. This is part of the exploit
1. Press "I accept" to accept the terms and conditions
1. The update will eventually fail, with the error code `003-1099`. This is intended behaviour
1. When asked "Would you like to configure Internet settings?", select "Yes"
1. On the following menu, navigate to `Connection 1` -> `Change Settings` -> `Next Page (right arrow)` -> `Proxy Settings` -> `Detailed Setup` ([image](/images/screenshots/usm/safemode_highlighted.png))
1. If the exploit was successful, your device will have booted into SafeB9SInstaller

#### Section III - Installing boot9strap

In this section, you will install custom firmware onto your device.

1. When prompted, input the key combo given on the top screen to install boot9strap
  + If the top screen is blank, power off your device and re-do Section III
1. Once it is complete, press (A) to reboot your device
1. Your device should have rebooted into the Luma3DS configuration menu
  + Luma3DS configuration menu are settings for the Luma3DS custom firmware. Many of these settings may be useful for customization or debugging
  + For the purpose of this guide, these settings will be left on default settings
  + If your device shuts down when you try to power it on, ensure that you have copied `boot.firm` from the Luma3DS `.zip` to the root of your SD card
1. Tekan (Start) untuk save dan reboot

At this point, your console will boot to Luma3DS by default.
  + Luma3DS does not look any different from the normal HOME Menu. If your console has booted into the HOME Menu, it is running custom firmware.
  + On the next page, you will install useful homebrew applications to complete your setup.

#### Section IV - Restoring WiFi Configuration Profiles

In this section, you will enter the Homebrew Launcher (this time using custom firmware) so that you can restore the Wi-Fi connection slots that were overwritten in Section I.

1. Launch the Download Play application
1. Wait until you see the two buttons
  + Do not press either of the buttons
1. Press (Left Shoulder) + (D-Pad Down) + (Select) at the same time to open the Rosalina menu
1. Select "Miscellaneous options"
1. Select "Switch the hb. title to the current app."
1. Press (B) to continue
1. Press (B) to return to the Rosalina main menu
1. Press (B) to exit the Rosalina menu
1. Press (Home), then close Download Play
1. Relaunch the Download Play application
1. Your device should load the Homebrew Launcher
1. Launch slotTool from the list of homebrew
1. Select "RESTORE original wifi slots 1,2,3"
1. Your device will then reboot
