### Required Reading

kartdlphax is an exploit for the Download Play mode of Mario Kart 7. It can be used with unSAFE_MODE to install custom firmware on target devices.

In order to follow these instructions, you will need the following:

- A second 3DS with custom firmware (the **source 3DS**) that is the same region as the 3DS you are trying to modify (the **target 3DS**)
- A physical or digital copy of Mario Kart 7 that is the same region as both consoles
- An SD card for both devices

If the (Right/Left Shoulder), (D-Pad Up), or (A) buttons on the **target 3DS** do not work, you will not be able to follow these instructions. For further assistance with this matter, join [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) and ask, in English, for help.
