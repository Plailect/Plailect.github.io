<summary><em>Technical Details (optional)</em></summary>
<p>To dump system DSiWare, we exploit a flaw in the DSiWare Data Management window of the Settings application.</p>
<p>To accomplish this, we use your system's encryption key (movable.sed) to build a DSiWare backup that exploits the system in order to dump the DSi Internet Settings application to the SD root.</p>
<p>For a more technical explanation, see <a href="https://github.com/zoogie/Bannerbomb3">here</a>.</p>
