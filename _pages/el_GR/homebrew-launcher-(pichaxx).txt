### Required Reading

This method of using Seedminer for further exploitation uses your `movable.sed` file to write a custom save file for Pokémon Picross, which can then be used with unSAFE_MODE to run SafeB9SInstaller.

This process will overwrite your Pokémon Picross save file, if you have one. If you wish to preserve your Pokémon Picross game data, you should make a backup of your `00000001.sav` file before overwriting it.
