#### Section IV - Configuring Luma3DS

1. Your device should have rebooted into the Luma3DS configuration menu
  + If you get a black screen, [follow this troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting#boot-related-issues-on-modded-devices)

  + On the next page, you will copy Luma3DS to internal memory so that you can boot without an SD card.

At this point, Pokémon Picross is no longer necessary and can be removed from your device.
