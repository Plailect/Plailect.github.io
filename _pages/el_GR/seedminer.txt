### Required Reading

To install boot9strap on your device, we derive your device's unique encryption key. To accomplish this, we use a tool called Seedminer to calculate the data encryption key (movable.sed) for your device.

For information on how Seedminer works, see [this presentation](https://zoogie.github.io/web/34⅕c3).

This method uses a powerful graphics card to perform the calculations needed. A volunteer-run website is used for the purpose of assisting you with this method.

### Instructions

#### Section I - Prep Work

1. Εισάγετε την κάρτα SD στον υπολογιστή σας
1. Navigate to the `Nintendo 3DS` folder on your SD card
1. Copy the 32 character long name of the folder you see inside Nintendo 3DS
  + Do not go inside any more folders
  + If you see multiple 32 character long folders, follow [these instructions](troubleshooting#multiple-long-folder-names-in-nintendo-3ds-folder)
  + You can ignore the `private` folder if you have it

	![]({{ "/images/screenshots/id0-example.png" | absolute_url }})
	{: .notice--info}
1. Paste your 32 character long folder name into a document you can reference later
  + This folder name is also known as your "ID0"
1. Power on your device
  + Your SD card does not need to be inserted at this point
1. Go to your Friend List (the [orange Face Icon]({{ "/images/friend-list-icon.png" | absolute_url }}) in the top row of your HOME Menu)
  + If you receive an error and are kicked out of the menu, you either must create a new Mii or your device cannot connect to Nintendo's servers (due to a ban or connection issues)
1. Find your Mii profile, then find the "Friend Code" field on the top screen

#### Section II - Seedminer

1. Join [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) on Discord and follow the instructions in the #mining-assistance channel
  + You will need to provide your friend code and ID0, after which a human will manually process your request
  + If you are unable to join the Discord server, wait for [Bruteforce Movable](https://seedminer.hacks.guide/) to come back online
1. When the process is completed, you will be provided your `movable.sed` file
  + Keep this file as you will need it in the upcoming pages

### Next Steps

Once you have your device's encryption key (`movable.sed`), you will use it in conjunction with other exploits to install custom firmware on your 3DS.

#### unSAFE_MODE (Recommended)

This method of using Seedminer for further exploitation uses your `movable.sed` file to take advantage of exploits in the SAFE_MODE firmware present in all 3DS units.

#### Taiwan consoles only

If you have a Taiwanese device (indicated with a T at the end of the system version, such as 11.15.0-39**T**), you must follow this route. **Other regions may not follow this route.**
