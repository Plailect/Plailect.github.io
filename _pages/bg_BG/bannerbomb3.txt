<summary><em>Technical Details (optional)</em></summary>

To launch custom code, we exploit a flaw in the DSiWare Data Management window of the Settings application.

To accomplish this, we use your system's encryption key (movable.sed) to build a DSiWare backup that exploits the system.

For a more technical explanation, see [here](https://github.com/zoogie/Bannerbomb3).
