As an additional safety measure, we will perform an additional check for custom firmware. This is because using this method when custom firmware is already installed has a risk of bricking the console (rendering it unusable without recovery methods like [ntrboot](ntrboot)).

1. Éteignez votre 3DS
1. Maintenez le bouton (Select) enfoncé
1. Allumez votre console tout en maintenant le bouton (Select) enfoncé
1. If the check was successful, you will boot to the HOME Menu and you may proceed with this guide
1. Éteignez votre 3DS

If you see a configuration menu or the console immediately powers off, you already have CFW, and continuing with these instructions may BRICK your device! Follow [Checking for CFW](checking-for-cfw) to upgrade your existing CFW.
