[PicHaxx](https://github.com/zoogie/pichaxx) is an exploit for the game Pokémon Picross released by [zoogie](https://github.com/zoogie), originally discovered and [demonstrated](https://twitter.com/mrnbayoh/status/744899681663258624) by [MrNbaYoh](https://github.com/MrNbaYoh).

This method of using Seedminer for further exploitation uses your `movable.sed` file to write a custom save file for Pokémon Picross, which can then be used to launch the Homebrew Launcher.

{: .notice--info}

This process will overwrite your Pokémon Picross save file, if you have one. If you wish to preserve your Pokémon Picross game data, you should make a backup of your `00000001.sav` file before overwriting it.
