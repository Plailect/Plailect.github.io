To install boot9strap on your console, we derive your console's unique encryption key. To accomplish this, we use the Homebrew Launcher to launch nimhax and dump the data encryption key (movable.sed) from your console.

For a more technical explanation, see [here](https://github.com/luigoalma/nimhax/) for information about the nimhax exploit.

### 你需要准备点啥？

* The latest release of [nimhax](https://github.com/luigoalma/nimhax/releases/latest) (the nimhax `.zip` file)

### 操作步骤

#### 第一步 – 准备工作

1. Power off your console
1. 将你的 SD 卡插入到电脑
1. Copy the `nimhax` folder from the nimhax `.zip` to the `/3ds/` folder on your SD card
1. Reinsert your SD card into your console
1. Power on your console

#### Section II - nimhax

1. Open the Homebrew Launcher through your method of choice (likely the Internet Browser)
1. Launch nimhax from the list of homebrew
1. If the exploit was successful, a `movable.sed` file will appear on the root of your SD card

### Next step: Frogtool

Once you have your console's encryption key (`movable.sed`), you can use it in conjunction with Frogtool, which uses your `movable.sed` file to inject and take advantage of JPN Flipnote Studio. \
While this method is faster, it requires downloading a file with a torrent client. Do not follow this method if you're unable to use a torrent client.
