boot9strap을 설치하려면 우선 각 기기의 고유 암호화 키를 알아내야 합니다. To accomplish this, we use the Homebrew Launcher to launch nimhax and dump the data encryption key (movable.sed) from your device.

For a more technical explanation, see [here](https://github.com/luigoalma/nimhax/) for information about the nimhax exploit.

### 준비물

* The latest release of [nimhax](https://github.com/luigoalma/nimhax/releases/latest) (the nimhax `.zip` file)

### 진행 방법

#### 섹션 I - 준비 작업

1. 기기를 종료해 주세요
1. SD 카드를 컴퓨터에 삽입해 주세요
1. Copy the `nimhax` folder from the nimhax `.zip` to the `/3ds/` folder on your SD card
1. SD 카드를 기기에 다시 삽입해 주세요
1. 기기를 시작해 주세요

#### Section II - nimhax

1. Open the Homebrew Launcher through your method of choice (likely the Internet Browser)
1. Launch nimhax from the list of homebrew
1. If the exploit was successful, a `movable.sed` file will appear on the root of your SD card

### Next step: Choose an exploit

#### Bannerbomb3 (recommended)

Once you have your device's encryption key (`movable.sed`), you can use it in conjunction with BannerBomb3, which uses your `movable.sed` file to take advantage of exploits in the System Settings application.

#### Frogtool

Once you have your device's encryption key (`movable.sed`), you can use it in conjunction with Frogtool, which uses your `movable.sed` file to inject and take advantage of JPN Flipnote Studio. \
While this method is faster, it requires downloading a file with a torrent client. Do not follow this method if you're unable to use a torrent client.
