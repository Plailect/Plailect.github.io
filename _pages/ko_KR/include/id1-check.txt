This occurs when you use multiple SD cards with the same 3DS and then merge the SD card contents together. Both are "valid", but the 3DS can only read one at a time.

You will need to determine which one contains your data. First of all, back up all of the folders, in case something goes wrong:

![Backup ID1](/images/screenshots/troubleshooting/backup-id1.png)
{: .notice--info}

Now, delete all but one of the folders from your SD card. Generally, you will want to delete the **smallest** one(s), as the one with all your data will probably have more space occupied. You can compare which folder is occupying more space by right-clicking it and clicking "Properties":

![Properties prompt](/images/screenshots/troubleshooting/rightclick-properties.png)
{: .notice--info}

![Which to delete](/images/screenshots/troubleshooting/compare-id1.png)
{: .notice--info}

SD 카드는 이제 이렇게 보일 것입니다.

![Just enough ID1s](/images/screenshots/troubleshooting/correct-id1.png)
{: .notice--info}

Now, put your SD card into your 3DS and turn it on. 데이터가 여전히 있다면, 정확한 폴더를 지운 것이고 정확한 ID1을 찾아낸 것입니다. 모든 게 다 없어졌다면, 백업해둔 폴더를 다시 SD 카드에 복원한 다음 다른 폴더를 지워보세요.
