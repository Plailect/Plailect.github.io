**3DS 펌웨어 11.17.0이 최근 출시되었습니다**. 다음 사항을 참고해 주세요.

- If your console is running *Luma 10.2.1 or higher*, it is *100% safe* to update. You can check your Luma version by holding (Select) while booting your console.
- If your console is on an older Luma version, you should [update Luma](checking-for-cfw) before you update your console to 11.17.0.
- If your console does not yet have custom firmware, **do NOT update to the latest version**, as installation methods may be more difficult.
- If your unmodified console is ALREADY on 11.17.0, this guide has been updated accordingly. Specifically, New3DS-family consoles have a [free software method](homebrew-launcher-(super-skaterhax)), while Old3DS-family consoles will need to use [alternate exploits](alternate-exploits) that rely on external hardware or software.
