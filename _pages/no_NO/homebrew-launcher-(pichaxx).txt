<summary><em>Technical Details (optional)</em></summary>
[PicHaxx](https://github.com/zoogie/pichaxx) is an exploit for the game Pokémon Picross released by [zoogie](https://github.com/zoogie), originally discovered and [demonstrated](https://twitter.com/mrnbayoh/status/744899681663258624) by [MrNbaYoh](https://github.com/MrNbaYoh).

This method of using Seedminer for further exploitation uses your `movable.sed` file to write a custom save file for Pokémon Picross, which can then be used to launch the Homebrew Launcher.

This process will overwrite your Pokémon Picross save file, if you have one. If you wish to preserve your Pokémon Picross game data, you should make a backup of your `00000001.sav` file before overwriting it.
