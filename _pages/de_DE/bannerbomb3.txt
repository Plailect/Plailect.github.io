<summary><em>Technical Details (optional)</em></summary>
<p>To launch custom code, we exploit a flaw in the DSiWare Data Management window of the Settings application.</p>
<p>To accomplish this, we use your system's encryption key (movable.sed) to build a DSiWare backup that exploits the system.</p>
<p>For a more technical explanation, see <a href="https://github.com/zoogie/Bannerbomb3">here</a>.</p>

### Compatibility Notes

These instructions work on USA, Europe, Japan, and Korea region consoles as indicated by the letters U, E, J, or K after the system version.

If you have a Taiwanese console (indicated by a T after the system version), follow [this page](bannerbomb3-fredtool-(twn)) instead.

### Was du brauchst

* Your `movable.sed` file from completing [Seedminer](seedminer)

#### Schritt I - Vorbereitungen

In this section, you will copy the files needed to trigger the BannerBomb3 exploit onto your device's SD card.

1. Schalte deinen 3DS aus
1. Stecke deine SD-Karte in deinen Computer
1. Open [Bannerbomb3 Injector](http://3dstools.nhnarwhal.com/#/bb3gen) on your computer
1. Upload your movable.sed using the “Choose File” option
1. Click “Build and Download”
  + This will download an exploit DSiWare called `F00D43D5.bin` and a payload called `bb3.bin` inside of a zip archive (`DSIWARE_EXPLOIT.zip`)
1. Copy `bb3.bin` from `DSIWARE_EXPLOIT.zip` to the root of your SD card
  + The root of the SD card refers to the initial directory on your SD card where you can see the Nintendo 3DS folder, but are not inside of it
1. Navigate to `Nintendo 3DS` -> `<ID0>` -> `<ID1>` on your SD card
  + `<ID0>` is the 32-letter folder name that you copied in [Seedminer](seedminer)
  + `<ID1>` is a 32-letter folder inside of the `<ID0>`
  ![]({{ "/images/screenshots/bb3/dsiware-location-1.png" | absolute_url }}){: .notice--info}
1. Create a folder named `Nintendo DSiWare` inside of the `<ID1>`
  + If you already had the folder *and* there are any existing DSiWare backup files (`<8-character-id>.bin`) inside, copy them to your PC and remove them from your SD card
1. Copy the `F00D43D5.bin` file from `DSIWARE_EXPLOIT.zip` to the `Nintendo DSiWare` folder

#### Section II - Hardware Button Check

In this section, you will test the SAFE_MODE function of your device. This will determine which method you will follow in the next page.

1. With your device still powered off, hold the following buttons: (Left Shoulder) + (Right Shoulder) + (D-Pad Up) + (A), and while holding these buttons together, power on your device
  + Keep holding the buttons until the device boots into Safe Mode (a "system update" menu)
1. If prompted to update, press Cancel
  + If the device boots to the HOME Menu, just continue to the next step
1. Schalte deinen 3DS aus

### Next steps: Choose an exploit

If your device booted into Safe Mode and prompted to you to do a system update in Section II, Safe Mode is working on your device.

If your device booted into Safe Mode, continue to [Installing boot9strap (USM)](installing-boot9strap-(usm))
{: .notice--primary}

If your device did NOT boot into Safe Mode, continue to [Installing boot9strap (Fredtool)](installing-boot9strap-(fredtool))
