## What is custom firmware?

**커스텀 펌워어** ("CFW")란, 3DS의 소프트웨어 개조이며, 컴퓨터의 "관리자 권한"과 비슷한 것입니다. 할 수 있는 걸 닌텐도에서 제한하는 것을 해제하고, 3DS가 하드웨어적으로 가능한 모든 것을 할 수 있게 합니다.

커스텀 펌웨어의 대표적인 사용은 이하와 같습니다.

- Running homebrew software and games made for or ported to the Nintendo 3DS
- Bypassing the region lock, allowing you to play games from other regions
- HOME Menu customization, using community-created [themes and badges](https://themeplaza.art)
- Modification of games ("ROM hacks") through [LayeredFS](https://github.com/knight-ryu12/godmode9-layeredfs-usage/wiki/Using-Luma3DS'-layeredfs-\(Only-version-8.0-and-higher\))
- Save data editing, backup, and restore
- Emulation of older consoles, as well as native playback of DS and GBA games
- Installing your physical cartridges for digital use

## What does this guide install?

이 가이드는:

- Install **boot9strap** and **Luma3DS custom firmware** on unmodified retail 3DS/2DS consoles
  - Luma3DS will automatically remove the region lock and allow you to run unsigned software
- Install various pieces of homebrew software, such as a package installer, save file manager, and a homebrew app store
- Make critical system file backups that can help avoid bricks (and recover data in the event of one)
