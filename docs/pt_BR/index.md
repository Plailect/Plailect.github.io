## What is custom firmware?

**Custom Firmware** ("CFW") é uma modificação completa de software para seu 3DS, comparável ao "acesso de administrador" de um computador. Ele permite que você faça qualquer coisa que o 3DS seja fisicamente capaz de fazer, ao invés de ser limitado por qualquer coisa que a Nintendo permite que você faça.

Usos populares para custom firmware incluem:

- Running homebrew software and games made for or ported to the Nintendo 3DS
- Bypassing the region lock, allowing you to play games from other regions
- HOME Menu customization, using community-created [themes and badges](https://themeplaza.art)
- Modification of games ("ROM hacks") through [LayeredFS](https://github.com/knight-ryu12/godmode9-layeredfs-usage/wiki/Using-Luma3DS'-layeredfs-\(Only-version-8.0-and-higher\))
- Save data editing, backup, and restore
- Emulation of older consoles, as well as native playback of DS and GBA games
- Installing your physical cartridges for digital use

## What does this guide install?

Este guia irá:

- Install **boot9strap** and **Luma3DS custom firmware** on unmodified retail 3DS/2DS consoles
  - Luma3DS will automatically remove the region lock and allow you to run unsigned software
- Install various pieces of homebrew software, such as a package installer, save file manager, and a homebrew app store
- Make critical system file backups that can help avoid bricks (and recover data in the event of one)
