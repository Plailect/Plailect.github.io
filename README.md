Custom firmware (“CFW”) is a full software modification to your 3DS, comparable to “administrator access” on a computer.
It allows you to do anything that the 3DS is physically capable of doing, rather than being limited by whatever Nintendo allows you to do.

This guide will:
Install boot9strap and Luma3DS custom firmware on unmodified retail 3DS/2DS devices
Luma3DS will automatically remove the region lock and allow you to run unsigned software
Install various pieces of homebrew software, such as a package installer, save file manager, and a homebrew app store
Make critical system file backups that can help avoid bricks (and recover data in the event of one).

**Get Started**

Section I - CFW Check
* Power off your device
* Hold the (Select) button
* Power on your device while still holding the (Select) button
* If you do not see an unusual menu (e.g. “Luma3DS Configuration”), you may proceed to the next section

Section II - System Version Check
* Open the System Settings application
* Your system version will be displayed on the bottom right of the top screen (e.g. “Ver. 11.15.0-47U”)

Section III - Select a Method
Use the version table below to select a method. A few things to note:
* The version table below is inclusive. For example, “from 11.4.0 to 11.14.0” includes 11.4.0, 11.14.0, and all versions in between.
* Software versions do not work the same as decimals. Versions 11.10.0 and above are newer than 11.3.0, and are therefore not compatible with Soundhax.
* The number and letter after the system version are not important.
* No matter the method you follow, the end result is the same (boot9strap+Luma3DS custom firmware setup on the latest firmware).

Alternate Methods
If possible, you should follow one of the software methods listed above.
Otherwise, methods that work on all versions are available, but require additional hardware:
* [Installing boot9strap (kartdlphax)](https://3ds.hacks.guide/installing-boot9strap-(kartdlphax)) - requires a 3DS with custom firmware and a copy of Mario Kart 7
* [ntrboot](https://3ds.hacks.guide/ntrboot) - requires compatible DS flashcart
* [Installing boot9strap (Hardmod)](https://3ds.hacks.guide/installing-boot9strap-(hardmod)) - requires soldering
